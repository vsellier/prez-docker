# Develop as in production

## Initialization

* Clone the ``exo-blog`` repository

## Startup

```
# cd exo-blog
# docker-compose up
```

The blog is accessible on http://localhost

This command is installing, configuring and starting a full environment with ``nginx``, ``wordpress`` and ``mysql`` from scratch without installing any software on the host.
It's exactly the same component as deploy in the preprod and production environment.
